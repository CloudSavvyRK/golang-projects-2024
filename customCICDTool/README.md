# Requirements:

## Integration with Version Control Systems (VCS):

- Ability to connect to popular version control systems like Git.

- Support for retrieving source code, including different branches and commits.

- Webhook integration for automatic triggering of builds on repository events (e.g., push, pull request).

## Build Automation:

- Automate the build process for applications, including compilation, dependency management, and packaging.

- Support for various programming languages and build tools.

- Efficient caching mechanisms to speed up subsequent builds by reusing dependencies.

## Automated Testing:

- Integrate with testing frameworks to automatically run tests as part of the build process.

- Support for unit tests, integration tests, and other types of tests.

- Capture and report test results to provide feedback on code quality.

## Artifact Management:

- Store and manage build artifacts generated during the build process.

- Support for versioning and tagging of artifacts.

- Ability to promote artifacts across different environments (e.g., development, staging, production).

## Deployment Pipelines:

- Define deployment pipelines to orchestrate the deployment process across environments.

- Support sequential and parallel execution of deployment stages.

- Integration with deployment tools for deploying applications to servers, containers, or cloud platforms.

## User Interface (Optional):

- Provide a user interface for configuring and monitoring pipelines, viewing build/test results, and managing artifacts.

- Support for role-based access control to restrict access to sensitive operations.

## Logging and Monitoring:

- Capture logs and metrics during the build and deployment process for troubleshooting and monitoring purposes.

- Integration with logging and monitoring solutions to aggregate and visualize data.
