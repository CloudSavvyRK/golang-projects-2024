Project Specifications:

Inspect Container Metadata:

Display container ID, name, image, status, ports, and environment variables.
Allow users to specify a container by ID or name.
Monitor Resource Usage:

Monitor CPU, memory, and network usage metrics for a specified container.
Provide real-time updates or periodic sampling of resource usage metrics.
Check Logs:

Retrieve and display logs from a container.
Support options to filter logs by timestamp, log level, or custom criteria.
Implement functionality to tail logs in real-time.
Inspect File System:

List files and directories within a container's file system.
Display file contents for selected files.
Allow users to specify a directory or file within the container to inspect.
How to Get Started:

Choose a Programming Language: Since you mentioned GoLang, we'll proceed with using GoLang for this project.

Familiarize Yourself with Docker API: The Docker Remote API provides endpoints for interacting with Docker containers, including retrieving container metadata, monitoring resource usage, accessing logs, and inspecting the file system. Familiarize yourself with the Docker Remote API documentation to understand the available endpoints and how to use them in your GoLang application.

Set Up Your Development Environment: Install GoLang and Docker on your development machine if you haven't already. You'll also need a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) for writing your GoLang code.

Design Your Application Architecture: Plan how you'll structure your GoLang application to interact with the Docker Remote API and handle user input and output. Consider breaking down your application into modular components for inspecting metadata, monitoring resource usage, fetching logs, and inspecting the file system.

Implement Docker API Integration: Write GoLang code to interact with the Docker Remote API endpoints for retrieving container metadata, monitoring resource usage, accessing logs, and inspecting the file system. Use the docker/docker GoLang client library or make HTTP requests directly to the Docker API endpoints.

Develop User Interface: Design a user-friendly command-line interface (CLI) for your Docker Container Inspector application using GoLang's flag package or a third-party library like cobra for building command-line interfaces.

Test Your Application: Write unit tests and integration tests to ensure that each component of your Docker Container Inspector application functions correctly. Test edge cases, error handling, and boundary conditions to validate the robustness of your application.

Document Your Application: Write documentation for your Docker Container Inspector application, including installation instructions, usage examples, and any dependencies or prerequisites. Consider generating documentation using tools like godoc or Markdown documentation files.

Deploy and Share Your Application: Once your Docker Container Inspector application is complete, deploy it to a public repository on GitHub or another platform of your choice. Share your project with the community, solicit feedback, and collaborate with others interested in Docker container inspection tools.

By following these steps, you can start building your Docker Container Inspector project in GoLang and gradually implement the specified features to create a useful tool for inspecting Docker containers and monitoring their performance. Remember to break down the project into manageable tasks and iterate on your implementation as you progress. Good luck!
